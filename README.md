abstract = {The growth of fake news has emerged as a substantial societal concern, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Fake news can lead to unwarranted panic, misinformed decisions, and a general state of confusion among the public. Existing methods to detect and filter out fake news have accuracy, speed, and data distribution limitations. This study explores a fast and reliable approach based on Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes algorithms for fake news detection on COVID-19 news in social networks. The study used a dataset of 10,700 tweets and applied text pre-processing, term-weighting, document frequency thresholding, and synthetic minority oversampling techniques (SMOTE) to prepare the data for classification. The study assessed the performance and runtime of four models: gradient boosting (GDBT), decision tree (DT), multinomial Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes (MNB), and complement Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes (CNB). The testing results showed that the CNB model reaches the highest accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of approximately 92% each, with the shortest runtime of 0.55 seconds. This study highlights the potential of the CNB model as an effective tool for detecting online fake news about COVID- 19, given its superior performance and rapid processing time.},
