This repository is dedicated for COVID-19 fake news detection and classification and includes the Python Code in Jupyter Notebook for the paper of [Fast Na√Øve Bayes classifiers for COVID-19 news in social networks]

The source code presented in this repository is adapted from [https://github.com/parthpatwa/covid19-fake-news-detection] (the original source code).

Thanks.
